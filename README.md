Hello! I am learning to create a Next.js React App for my Portfolio, coding along with [JavaScript Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F627pKNUCVQ).

## Key Learnings: 
- learning the advanced way of modularising code
- understand the surface benefits of next.js
- learning to use styled components
- debugging code with potential issues (version, outdated synthaxes)
